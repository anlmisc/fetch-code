/*
Here we are converting the values of `zero` in FINAL_QUANTITY to 0. We are also CASTing it as a FLOAT and ROUNDing to get rid of the decimals.
I am making the assumption that you cannot have a partial unit of quantity. It could be the case where that represents something like weight.
for example if you are buying produce by the pound, but I am assuming that is not the case due to the previous query. That query shows all the
product info for the barcodes that have a decimal in their FINAL_QUANTITY. The ROUNDing is giving the benefit of the doubt to any numbers less 
than 1 and rounding them up, all other numbers are rounded normally.

/* FINAL QUERY TO FIX DATA ISSUES FOR PRODUCTS */
/*
The final fix is to group the records, but we will be taking the MAX value for FINAL_QUANTITY AND FINAL_SALE.
There are records that are identical but have differing FINAL_QUANTITY AND FINAL_SALE. This data appears to represent a receipt with its items.
There should not be multiple records for the same barcode within a receipt_id, that should be taken care of in the FINAL_QUANTITY field. We are taking the MAXIMUM as
we are making the assumption that if both numbers were recorded, perhaps the smaller number was pulled incorrectly as a "per unit price" or it could
have been something completely different. There are some fields that have a 0 for FINAL_SALE, but We actually do not want to exclude any records 
that satisfy this condition because they could be coupons (which we do not have data for), or something similar, that reduced the final amount to 0.
